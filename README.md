# FinTrack
Welcome to FinTrack, your ultimate finance tracker designed to simplify and streamline your financial management.

financial health with detailed graphs and charts. Our app helps you stay on top of your finances by offering a clear weekly overview, 
ensuring you make informed decisions and achieve your financial goals.
